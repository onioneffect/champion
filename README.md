This is a demo of the first version of this program.

* The video ain't exactly safe for work
* The first version of the program is a bit hard to figure out.
It's in the `other/old/` directory if you want to give it a shot
* The people in the video are speaking Portuguese,
but you can probably figure out what's happening

## USAGE:
`./champion.exe [options] [arguments]`

#### Available options:
```
--help: Print help message and exit
--debug: Enable logging (more info)
--file: Specify where to write log output
```

## USAGE:
WIP

## TODO:
* ~~Rewrite entire program in a single language~~
* Write a proxy server to make the whole process easier
* ~~Add different encoding for images (Gartic and TeeKO)~~
* Write alternative encoding module in Go
